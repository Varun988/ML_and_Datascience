This Streamlit application allows users to upload a CSV dataset, perform data cleaning, and visualize key insights such as correlation, outliers, and skewness. The user can select a specified number of rows from the dataset, with an option to sample up to 40% of the data by default.

Key features of the application include:

File Upload: Users can upload their dataset (CSV file).
Row Selection: Users can choose the number of rows to sample from the dataset.
Data Cleaning:
Missing numerical values are imputed using the median.
Missing categorical values are imputed using the most frequent value.
Categorical columns are encoded using label encoding.
Data Visualizations:
Correlation Matrix: A heatmap to explore relationships between numerical features.
Outlier Detection: Identification of outliers using Z-scores and visualization through boxplots.
Skewness Analysis: Display of skewness values for numerical features.
Model Training: Users can select features and target columns, then train and evaluate models using LazyClassifier. It automatically fits multiple classification models and displays their accuracy scores.
This application is designed for users who want to quickly clean and analyze their dataset, visualize key data characteristics, and train machine learning models for classification tasks.
